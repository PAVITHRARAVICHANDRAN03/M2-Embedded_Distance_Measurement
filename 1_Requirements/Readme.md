## Introduction

Ultrasonic sensors are great tools to measure distance and detect objects without any actual contact with the physical world. It is used in several applications, like in measuring liquid level, checking proximity and even more popularly in automobiles to assist in self-parking or anti-collision systems. Previously we have also build many Ultrasonic Sensor projects like water level detecting, Ultrasonic Radar etc . This is an efficient way to measure small distances precisely. In this project, we have used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with Atmega328 to determine the distance of an obstacle from the sensor. The basic principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in the environment then waves return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on the obstacle. So we only need to calculate the traveling time of both sounds means outgoing time and returning time to origin after striking on the obstacle. As the speed of the sound is known to us, after some calculation we can calculate the distance.

## Research

Nowadays, we have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape is an easy option, but this kind of tool will have a limitation of manual error. Before this, engineers have produced a range finder module but in the end, they find out the module have many disadvantages like limitation for distance, different result for different coloured obstacles, and need a calibration for every time before starts using it. Manual distance measuring is always done at the expense of human error. Precise and fix measurement of low range distance, is the main objective for this project. .This project is used to measure the distance by using ultrasonic sensors.

## Features and Cost and Timeline

1. Used to measure the obstacle distance.

2. This system used in automotive parking sensors and obstacle warning systems.

3. Used in terrain monitoring robots

## Defining Our System

The Clinic Management System was develop in a simple console application, the system can openly-accessed without the help of any login information. The user can do a lot of task in the system in the system, he/she can add new patient record, view all patient record, edit current patient record, and search patient record. The system has the function that can enter a patient details, you are also allowed to update the current patient record or delete existing patient record. The inputted data are stored in the text extension file. The Clinic Management System was created in a basic coding structure of C to teach and help beginner to start their programming career. 
 Clinic Management System is design to help the employee in recording the patient's record and will change the manual record into computerized records.

#### 1. New technology

#### 2. Lack of dominant Competition

#### 3. New markets or services

### Threats:

####  1. New or increased competition

#### 2. Insurance plan changes

#### 3. Adverse demograghic changes

#### 4. Economic slowdowns
## 4W's and 1'H

WHAT:

Hospital management system is a computer system that helps manage the information related to health care and aids in the job completion of health care providers effectively.

WHY:

HMS was introduced to solve the complications coming from managing all the paper works of every patient associated with the various departments of hospitalization with confidentiality. HMS provides the ability to manage all the paperwork in one place, reducing the work of staff in arranging and analyzing the paperwork of the patients.

WHERE:

This systems useful in healthcare like hospitals/clinics.

WHEN:

A clinic management system is used to manage the patients, the appointments, the doctors' schedules, manage the inventory, etc. It makes the otherwise difficult task of managing a clinic.

How:

Clinic management system improves the general efficiency of the organization by automating the entire system.The software helps in streamlining every element of a healthcare center. Some of which includes recordkeeping, printing out prescriptions,scheduling patients' appointments.
